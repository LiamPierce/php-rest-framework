# php-rest-framework
## Overview
This is an open source REST framework created by William Pierce to aid in the creation of APIs.

This rest API has the following:

1. Object validation trait to allow for even the most complex schemas to be loaded and validated
2. Token bucket rate limiting
3. File upload handling
4. Authentication handling
5. Per-method and per-endpoint authentication, rate limits
6. Method redirection (eg POST => GET) for testing
